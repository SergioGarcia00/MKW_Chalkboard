## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright red (#FF4136), inspired by Mario's iconic cap, evokes energy and excitement. This color will serve as the primary accent throughout the interface.
- Background color: Light pink (#FFDDE0). This muted backdrop is visibly related to the primary color but softly desaturated to ensure focus remains on the track design. It also nods to the playful nature of Mario Kart without being distracting.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFDC00), mirroring the stars of Mario Kart. A vivid and saturated color, which draws user attention to specific parts of the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins', a sans-serif font for a modern and easy-to-read interface. It keeps the overall design sleek without overwhelming it.
- Use recognizable, playful icons from the Mario Kart universe for item boxes, characters and obstacles, creating an instantly familiar and enjoyable experience.
- Design a drag-and-drop interface with a clear separation between the map canvas and the icon library for intuitive map creation. Minimize clutter to maximize usability.
